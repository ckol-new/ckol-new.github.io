A knight's Ghost sits lakeside,
moonlit,  cast life upon waters edge.
Trick Moon above and its silver lies 
weave a story long old.
Eyes set upon his fickle mirror,
rusted armor, shiny tonight
where damaged plates peels
back to reveal living flesh and
old glory, demarked in his armor, 
lions and giants, family crests
shines polished.
Moonlit, life cast into water,
a hollow dream, but very real tonight.
Trick Moon, crescent, sings
a faint song into ears open
with the mercy of a sad promise.
