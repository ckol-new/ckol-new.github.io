Weathered moor, sun peeks around
split dock posts, frayed rope tangles,
I sit still, patient, and wait.
The Gull's call out, but not to me.
A call to the sea,
to violent swirls and eddies.
The salt spray, sharp on my face
as fog makes canvas,
and the light house paints
yellow across the sky.
I see an old ship in my eyelids,
but the horizon is empty,
and the sea swallows
and murmurs, like madness
I see that old ship.
