A knight's Ghost sits lakeside,
moonlit,  cast life upon waters edge.
Trick Moon above and its silver lies 
weave a story long old.
Eyes set upon his fickle mirror,
rusted armor, shiny tonight
where damaged plates peels
back to reveal living flesh and
Old Glory, demarked in his armor, 
lions and giants, family crests
shines polished.
Moonlit, life cast into water,
A hollow dream, very real tonight
Trick Moon, crescent, sings
a light song into ears open,
with the mercy of a sad promise.
