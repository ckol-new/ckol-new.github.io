Lament / Klage by Rainer Maria Rilke
Translation by Stephen Mitchell 
<br>
<i>Everything is far 
and long gone by.
I think that the star 
glittering above me 
has been dead for a million years.
I think there were tears 
in the car I heard pass 
and something terrible was said. 
A clock has stopped striking in the house 
across the road... 
When did it start? 
I would like to stop step out of my heart 
and go walking beneath the enormous sky. 
And surely all of the stars that perished 
long ago, 
one still exists. 
I think that I know 
which one it is-- 
which one, at the end of its beam in the sky, 
stand like a white city... </i>
