                I found early on in life, that the refuge other's found in God was not welcome to me. I could only imagine what they felt. Their Reverence shined clearly, but beneath there was a Namelessness. I felt it in the back of my throat in churches, and in Christian summer camps.

This namelessness, it felt distant. I don't think I ever felt it as clearly as they did. Forgive me then, for my attempts to manifest it here. 

I am inspired by Rilke, in his collection "The Book of Hours" to say that this God (at least that is what I know him by), seems to appear only for a moment. He appears, and in his shadow, one finds community in him alone. An understanding beyond what you can understand. But for as long as this is pronounceable, it quickly shifts and falls back, an endless falling. Infinite distance sprouts forth, and one finds him again inaccessible. 

I think this is where faith steps in. It is a bridge. But that is what seems to me, faith's very futile essence. A bridge to where? This has always been my principal question. For belief in God, is not purely rational, thus it must occupy the phenomenal. It lives in the world of perception, ephemeral breeze on ones neck. Comfort, growing like a snake up ones leg. Belief in God, lies here, in the world of irreducible perception.

But try to step forwards into this breeze, into this comfort? And one finds himself lost immediately, adrift like new shades to Elysium. Faith marks an attempt to bridge this infinite distance (and it is infinite), by pulling the experience of God away from the transient sensory world, to a more manifest dimension. It makes God mundane, like an unanswered invitation to the ordinary. Faith exists in this world, the world of dishes, and clothing, and sidewalks. But the experience of God, is so far removed from this world. It only appears, in moments, fragments, where the rain itself seems enchanted by him.



This is what I never had. Any notion of God, seemed to reject and defeat itself in my young head. A story nothing more than a story. I find here, there was a dimension of bitterness. A jealousy, to what I had not, and it grew into convinced superiority. 

But do not mistake me for a jealous Cynic. I tried, and believe me, have I tried to pull God close, bridge the distance. But I am left only with one image in my head.

Night cries, unanswered. 
Calls out in the dark, 
by children and all. 
Little voices, hush below church roof,
obedient, and at night, cry. 
Night cries, 
echo, 
and bounce seemingly impossible distance
reaching my ears. 
Screaming Bleak, 
through snow and desert alike, 
through Bomb-Cloud 
and hungry screaming clawing hands. 
Crying night, 
pitiless stars,
hospital beds,
flatlines.
All attempting to draw back together 
a clean Portrait of God. 
For every enchanted raindrop, 
must be reconciled with every pit, 
every hole, 
and every
tear of despair.
