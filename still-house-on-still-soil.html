<h1> A Still House, On Still Soil </h1>
<div class="poem-container">
        <pre>
By Christopher Kollar
December 23rd, 2025





In a house that does not rot
on soil, still, settled
for a long rest

long, too long,
since the clamour of pots
ring forth and through

halls enchanted by smells
making it a home.



There is a funeral car in front of me,
a terrible slow, black, wagon,
I cannot catch up

It is my grandfather's funeral,
I cannot catch up.
soil gently scatters on wood top

and laid gently down,
in soil, still, settled



In a house that does not rot,
foundation weary creaking,
marks not age, not time

something else, forgotten
within the dream, where light
is too still as

beam-falls on floors too clean,
and no pots clamour.



There is a procession in front of me,
a terrible, slow, crowd
I cannot catch up.

It is my funeral,
I cannot catch up.
the delirium of age roars by,

like dementia of time, slowly
in soil, still, settled.



It is a still house on still soil
no pots clamour,
no smells enchant,
light falls still,
still, light falls,
housing nothing at all
