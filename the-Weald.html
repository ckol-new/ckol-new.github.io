the Weald twists and churns,
roots gnaw into brown earth,
bark scrapes and groans under
the weight of the canopy above.
A weary Traveller, on tired trail 
worn somehow into mossed floor 
by the futility of a thousand steps.

Dark, no stars seen in the above Vast;
thick leaves, like hoods, conspire against
any light - but a Moon Beam slips through,
leaves part to allow its passing down.
Silvery, elven, a spotlight
separating tree from tree,
here from there,
then from now...

there stands a Beautiful Women
cast in moon light like floating dust,
but continuous with the forest floor.
Her dress drapes, silken, and blends into 
the spent leaves below; ever autumnal.
But as the Traveller steps forwards,
she fades... 
A trick of the light...
