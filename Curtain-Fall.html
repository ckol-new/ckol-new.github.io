    <h1> Curtain Fall </h1>

A looming curtain,
black as night,
before me I see you dance.

my demise - a curtain fall,
as the stage closes
for the long night

it drapes you so,
so much like silk
that hangs off your skin

Black as night, black
as my demise - a curtain fall
as our scene ends

for the long night
