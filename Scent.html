the life is gone,
o' wisp that remains
husk of Scent
empty -- still,
empty, but for a moment
I let it creep in.

a Scent alive and moving,
memories lived in
return, back and clear,
bright before my eyes
Amber Light shadows
your warm Scent
with a Presence
immediate to me.

Us, back in that meadow,
Daylight,
still for a moment
like we were never
lost at all.
And here you are,
Unconditional love
Inseparable!
