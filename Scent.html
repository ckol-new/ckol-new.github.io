the life is gone,
o' wisp that remains
a husk of Scent
empty -- still,
empty, but for a moment
I let it creep in.

a Scent alive and moving,
memories lived in
return -- back and clear,
bright before my eyes
I see you still,
Amber Light shadows
your warm Scent
with Presence
immediate to me.

Us, back in that meadow,
for a moment
like we were never
lost at all.
And here you are,
Unconditional
Inseparable!
