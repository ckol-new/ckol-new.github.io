November 10th, 2025

the life is gone,
o' wisp that remains
a husk of Scent
empty -- still,
empty, but for a moment
I let it at night
creep in,
a Scent alive and moving,
memories lived in
return -- back and clear,
bright before my eyes
I see you still,
Amber Light shadows
a warm Scent
with Presence
immediate to me.
Us, back in that meadow,
for a moment
like we were never
lost.

Unconditional
Inseparable!
